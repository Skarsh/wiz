# Wiz
Windowing in Zig


## Introduction
This is currently a heavily experimental and WIP project. I am using it in my own Game project and developing features and fixing bugs
as they show up there.

# Building
`zig build` to build the `main` and `opengl-example` executables.
`zig build -Denable_tracy=true` to enable tracy profiling.
